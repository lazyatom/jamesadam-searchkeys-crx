SearchKeys extension for Chromium and Google Chrome
Copyright (C) 2009 Mark Pilgrim

This extension adds keyboard shortcuts to Google web search results.
Pressing "1" navigates to the first result, "2" to the second, and
so on.

Inspired by Jesse Ruderman's excellent SearchKeys extension for
Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/339
